# SVM_FOR_CANCER_DETECTION
We design a SVM Machine to identify the either the cell is cancer or not.
## SVM to Classify Cancer Cells
* Use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records
* Classify cells as benign or malignant based on their characteristics
* Map data to a high-dimensional feature space to enable categorization
* Identify and draw a hyperplane as a separator between categories
* Predict the classification of new data based on trained model characteristics
